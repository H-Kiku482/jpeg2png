If you select the file path of a jpeg binary file as the argument, the output will be in png format.
In the case of a directory, the output is recursively output to another directory that mimics the tree structure.

Usage:
    imfconv [FILE.jpeg]...
    imfconv [DIRECTORY]...
    imfconv [JPEG_MEMORY_BLOCK.txt]
